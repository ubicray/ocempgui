0. Description:
---------------

OcempGUI is a toolkit, which comes with various modules suitable for
event management, user interfaces, 2D drawing and accessibility. It is
completely written in Python[0] and its drawing routines and user
interface elements are created with and especially created for the
pygame[1] library.

OcempGUI enables developers to enhance their python and/or pygame
applications and games easily with graphical UI elements such as
buttons, entry boxes, scrolling abilities and more as well as simple
event brokers or features, which enhance the program by adding
accessibility to its objects.

It can save a developer much time by letting providing a broad range of
drawing routines and ready-to-use event capable object types.
The developer can focus on the main tasks instead of taking care about
needed low-level components, which are given to him with OcempGUI.

1. Installation:
----------------

You can either use the python way of installing the package or the make
command using the Makefile.
Simply type

    python setup.py install 

for the traditional python way or

    make install

for using the Makefile. 

It must be said, that the install target of the Makefile does not do
anything else than the python way. It simply calls 'python setup.py
install'.

1.1. Dependencies
-----------------

The minimum required dependencies of OcempGUI are

    Python, at least version 2.3
    PyGame, at least version 1.7.1*

The system backend of the ocempgui.access module has the following
additional requirements to be built successfully:

   C Compiler        which supports the C99 standard (at least large
                     parts of it) such as GCC[0].
   ATK               at least version 1.12.1 and its dependencies[1].
   pkg-config        for automatic generation of the compiler flags[2].
   
If none of the ocempgui.access requirements can be met, you can install
OcempGUI anyways, but will not be able to use the accessibility support
offered by it through the ocempgui.access module.

* Earlier versions of OcempGUI (< 0.2.0) will work fine with PyGame 1.6.

1.2 Notes on CVS usage
----------------------

The CVS versions of OcempGUI are not recommended to be used in a
productive application environment. Interfaces my change from one
checkin to another, methods, classes or modules can be broken and so
on. If you want more reliable code, please refer to the official
releases.

If you are going to use a CVS snapshot of the actual development
versions, it is highly recommended, that you run

    make release

before trying to install the package. The CVS version contains several
methods and quirks for additional debugging output, profiling code and
more, which are removed by the release target of the Makefile.
Not invoking make release will slow down the library heavily and can
make it unusable for your application or game.

Afterwards, change into the created dist directory, unpack the build tar
ball and install it as described in the previous section. By using the
tar ball, you avoid installing superfluous files such as the xml source
of the documentation and UML diagrams:

   cd dist
   tar xzvf OcempGUI-X.X.X.tar.gz
   cd OcempGUI-X.X.X
   make install

Note, that you will need to have dia[0] and libxslt[1] installed in
order to run the release target successfully for the documentation.

1.3 Notes for Windows users
---------------------------

The windows pygame installer for version 1.7.1 and below will not ship
with the python Numeric package. OcempGUI relies on this package for
drawing with pygame <= 1.7.1 , thus you should explicitly install the
Numeric[0] package. Note, that you will need a package called
"Numeric-....exe". The "numarray-....exe" packages offered at the
download site are NOT what you want.

The accessibility support of ATK is currently not available on Win32
platforms. You should be able build the module without problems, but
cannot make use of assistive technologies using the MSAA accessibility
system (ATK does not support that).

Do not use the dist or dist_wininst targets for installing
OcempGUI. Instead use the plain 'python setup.py install' procedure.
The dist and dist_wininst turn out to break the installation process for
the themes as they do not rewrite the DEFAULTDATADIR entry within
ocempgui/widgets/Constants.py correctly. You then might run something
like the following error then.

  File "C:\Python24\Lib\ocempgui\widgets\base.py", line 29, in ?
    from Style import Style
  File "C:\Python24\Lib\ocempgui\widgets\Style.py", line 36, in ?
    from themes import default
ImportError: No module named themes

If you consider this error, first check Constants.py, if DEFAULTDATADIR
points to the correct themes directory. If it does not, please consider
reinstalling OcempGUI using 'python setup.py install'.
A patch for this issues is currently not available.

1.4 Notes for Mac OS users
--------------------------

The accessibility support of ATK is currently not available on Macintosh
platforms. You should be able build the module without problems, but
cannot make use of assistive technologies using the Mac accessibility
system (ATK does not support that).

2. Getting started
------------------

After finishing the installation, you will find tons of documentation,
diagrams and examples in the <prefix>/share/doc/ocempgui directory of your
OcempGUI intallation. The prefix usually relies on the Python
installation prefix. So if Python was installed to /usr/local, you will
find the OcempGUI documentation beneath /usr/local/share/doc/ocempgui.

Have fun.
